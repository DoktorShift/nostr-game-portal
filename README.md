I added onlien Status

- Live player list - See who's currently online and recently active in the app.

ðŸ‘† For now to see the function works i took the accounts follower list and tracked online status of the following lists people. 
My idea is to change that code later to track a dedicated relay (or relays!) and a specific "kind" event to display online status related to people who are playing our games. Because our games will use custom event we can track that.

- Smart status indicators - Green dot for online (active within 15 minutes), yellow dot for recently active (within 24 hours)

- Smooth scrolling carousel - Browse through all online players with a swipe-friendly interface

- Player profiles - Tap any player to see their profile and some extra we could add in future. (Message, Send sats, Invite to game)

- Auto-refresh - The list updates every 2 minutes to show the latest activity.
